    Bartlettâ€™s Test of Sphericity compares an observed correlation matrix to
    the identity matrix. Essentially it checks to see if there is a certain redundancy
    between the variables that we can summarize with a few number of factors.
    This test is used as a precursory test for Factor Analysis or PCA.
