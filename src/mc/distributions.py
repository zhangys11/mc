    """
    The Zipf law / distribution is published in 1949 by Harvard linguist George Kingsley Zipf. 
    It can be expressed as follows: in the corpus of natural language, 
    the frequency of a word appears inversely proportional to its ranking 
    in the frequency table. 
    The experiment associated with this law is the paper clip experiment, 
    that is, two paper clips are randomly drawn and connected together, 
    then put back, and then do the above again. 
    After enough rounds, the clips of different lengths will obey zipf distribution. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_rounds : The number of random samples. 抽样拼接次数

    num_clips_k : The total number of paper clips should be greater than [num_rounds]. This is the ratio of the numbers. 
    Should always > 1. Some of values are 1.6, 1.8, 2, 2.5, 3.

    Returns
    -------
    The histogram generated by this experiment is generated when alpha takes a different value or k takes a different value.

    Note
    ----
    Internally, we use grid search via the KLD metric to determine the best-fit zipf dist.
